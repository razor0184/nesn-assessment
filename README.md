## Project Overview

The NESN Assessment project aims to test the integration of CompanyB's API into CompanyA's live streaming platform. The goals are to ensure that the API scales under load, maintains backward compatibility, and integrates seamlessly across multiple client applications.

## Test Plans

### Functional Test Plan

The functional test plan covers all major functionalities of the integrated API and client applications. It includes scenarios like user authentication, content posting, and viewing, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

### Automated Test Plan

The automated test plan focuses on reducing manual effort by automating key test cases across API and client applications. Tools like Selenium, Postman, and Appium are recommended.

### Load Test Plan

The load test plan ensures that the platform can handle expected user loads during live streams and identifies the systemâ€™s breaking points under stress.
